<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

<div id="about-the-project"></div>

### About the Project

This project consists on a simple web page that provides the user with a card-styled element with information about a GitHub repository. This card can either be downloaded as a PNG, or as HTML and CSS code. The easiest way to find out what the project is about is to use it! :v:

It's hosted using GitHub pages :point_right:

<div id="motivation"></div>

#### Motivation

My goal is to help people showcase and share their GitHub repositories with ease.

Not a long time ago, I was the one looking for a quick way to expose my repositories on my personal website. To my surprise, there were not many options to chose from. One of which was [this project](https://github.com/lepture/github-cards), from which I took some inspiration. :sparkles: After deciding that the best approach would be for me to do it myself - even though I'm not very good at front-web developing - I had the idea of sharing my work so that other people in my situation have an easier task than mine.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

<div id="getting-started"></div>

### Getting Started

It's very straightforward to get the project up and running locally. As simple as cloning the repository and opening the `index.html` file on a browser.

<div id="future-work"></div>

### Future Work

There is clearly room for improvement in terms of functionalities.

For starters, the user should have a say in what information should be displayed on the card. They should be able to select if, for example, the description, or the number of watchers should be displayed or not. A nice addition would be to also add the languages involved in the project. Furthermore, more image formats should be supported for download. Another known limitation is that GitHub's emoji notation is not supported.

To finish, I'm not a great front-end developer, as I mentioned. The code is a mess and could certainly be improved. :innocent:
